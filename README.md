***
What is the goal? We wanted to explore to what degree a model can be trained to create unique Picasso-Style Art Paintings. 


How is it done? We are using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN). The code is written using the Keras Sequential API with a tf.GradientTape training loop. It leverages the Google Quickdraw Dataset, widely known as the world's biggest sketch data repository. 

It can be access directly via this link. Please make sure to select two nouns and one filter.
